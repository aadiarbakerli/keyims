foreignKeys Project Two Proposal

Project Description

The foreignKeys group will create an IMS project that manages keys, literal keys such as those that open doors as well as figurative keys, such as passwords.  Our database will consist of users that may have multiple keys, and the keys may have copies of itself in the hands of other different users.  The keys themselves will be stored on the AWS RDS database along with the corresponding users using Java, Oracle SQL, and Hibernate.  Front end presentation of our project would be handled in Angular and perhaps Spring, wherever it falls into this project.
